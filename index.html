          <h2>Formal Negotiation</h2>
          <span class="product-description">
            <p>
              In a world where power is a game of leverage, Formal Negotiation delves into the intricacies of deals, betrayals, and the art of
              persuasion.
            </p>
            <p>
              When corporate strategist Elise Mercer is thrust into a high-stakes merger between two rival tech empires, she quickly realizes this is no
              ordinary negotiation. The boardroom becomes a battlefield, and Elise must navigate hidden agendas, buried secrets, and volatile alliances.
              As tensions escalate, what begins as a professional challenge turns personal, exposing the fragility of trust in a cutthroat world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Behind closed doors, the stakes extend beyond profit margins. A mysterious player seems determined to sabotage the deal, and Elise finds 
              herself questioning her loyaltiesâ€”and her limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Will Elise outmaneuver her opponents and secure her future, or will the pressures of ambition cost her everything?
            </p>
            <p>

              reward, perfect for fans of sharp, suspenseful corporate drama.
